I've seen the word _culture_ abused quite a lot recently.
People will apply the word _culture_ to many things where I don't believe is warranted, for example:

- American culture
- Geek/Nerd culture
- Company culture

I would argue none of these things exist, yet people will keep repeating those words.
Let's dive into the etymology of _culture_.[^1]

Obviously, the closest English relative is the term _cultivate_.
When I think of cultivation, I think of careful planning and fostering for the purpose of a seed to bear abundant fruit.
Culture is a powerful word which when applied to human societies, I believe, is meant to represent powerful, vast, and omnipresent things.

Ancient traditions and histories of Asian, African, and European populations I believe are a great example of what to apply the word _culture_ to.
Europeans have been around for nearly one hundred thousand years and Asia and Africa are many times older than that.
_That_ kind of history and tradition is what culture is, not having pinball machines in a room in your office building.

The Chinese people have been performing a celebration most of the world has heard about for over 40 centuries: Chinese New Year.
Now, that's not a lot of time in human history, but a person in China today has had generations upon generations of societal building of the celebration.
It is _the most important day of the year for an entire populace_.
No Star Wars movie can even come close that[^2], because Chinese New Year is _actual_ culture that exists today.

What we perceive as culture today can most likely be replaced with _tradition_, or _lifestyle_.
I actually like the word lifestyle the most hereâ€”it represents a way of living _at the current time_ and not presenting itself as a multi-century-old way of life affecting millions of people.

I think that people today (from an American point of view) want more culture in their lives because they noticeably lack it, but can see it exists in other places/people around them.
Culture is so valued by Americans today, though, and they have begun to falsely make things part of "American culture" just so they can say they have it.
