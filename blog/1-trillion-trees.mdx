Maybe I'm around my Kentucky-based family too much,
but it climate change is a touchy subject for some.
I think, though, the real touchiness stems from one of two issues:

1. The Earth is going to die and I don't want to think I'm responsible
1. Who is going to pay to fix it, because I sure don't

That's probably a gross misrepresentation, but that's not the real point.
If we truly can just plant 1T trees and solve the climate change problem,
then I am fully 100% on-board with getting it done.

I've been a huge fan of bamboo once I heard about its properties compared to wood: It uses less water and it takes less time to grow, all while retaining the strength and texture of wood.
I'm also a huge fan of meat alternatives such as Impossible Foods' plant-based "meats."
